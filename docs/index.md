# Inputs Package Overview 

Inputs are fields which allow for an input of data, based on a specific and predefined format. Currently, Inputs include the Kendo UI Slider component for React.

The Slider lets users select a value from a predefined range. The values can be increased or decreased over a pre-defined step by dragging a handle along the track, or by clicking the side arrow buttons. The component supports two modes of display&mdash;horizontal and vertical.
