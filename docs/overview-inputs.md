# Inputs Package Overview (draft)

Inputs are fields which allow for an input of data based on a specific and predefined format. The Inputs package includes the Kendo UI for React MaskedTextBox, NumericTextBox, Switch, and Slider components.

The MaskedTextBox allows user input based on a specific format that can be defined through using mask options. Mask options represent mask rules and determine the format of the content that is expected to be filled out. The MaskedTextBox also has predefined rules which specify the required or optional input of digits, letters, and characters. It supports configuration options that can be set during initialization, such as the value of the component and its mask, custom mask rules, prompt characters, and culture names, and provides for the application of custom rules for its configuration options.

The NumericTextBox supports numeric entries only and converts input elements into a numeric, percentage, or currency textbox. Its conversion data types are applied according to their predefined format. The NumericTextBox renders spin buttons which allow the increase and decrease of values based on predefined steps and also supports cultures. It supports configuration options that can be set during initialization, such as the minimum and maximum values, incremental steps, number precision and format.  

The Switch is used to display two exclusive choices&mdash;when initialized, it shows the currently selected option; when users slide it, they reveal and, in this way, select the other option.   

The Slider lets users select a value from a predefined range. The values can be increased or decreased over a pre-defined step by dragging a handle along the track, or by clicking the side arrow buttons. The component supports two modes of display&mdash;horizontal and vertical.
