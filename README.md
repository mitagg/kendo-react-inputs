## Basic Usage

### MaskedTextBox

The MaskedTextBox allows user input based on a specific format that can be defined through using mask options.

```
```jsx
```

```
```jsx
```

For more information, refer to the [NumericTextBox documentation](overview-maskedtextbox).

### Switch

The Switch is used to display two exclusive choices&mdash;when initialized, it shows the currently selected option; when users slide it, they reveal and, in this way, select the other option.
